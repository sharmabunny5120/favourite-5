                <h2>Today I am going to tell you about my favourite hobby which is playing piano and guitar!</h2>
                <p id="sentence">My hobby is to playing piano, guitar and sing. I like to play amazing songs on piano, I like to sing anywhere in the world. I am 12 years old and I study in suncity school, gurgaon and I am in 6th grade. Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. It is one of the cultural universal aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek Î¼Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹ÎºÎ® (mousike; "(art) of the Muses"); see Â§ Etymology and glossary of musical terminology.</p><a class="more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music#:~:text=Music%20is%20the%20art%20of,aspects%20of%20all%20human%20societies." target="_blank">Click here to learn more about music</a>

<p>Arijit Singh was born on 25 April 1987 in Jiaganj, Murshidabad, West Bengal to Kakkar Singh, a Sikh father and a Bengali mother. He began his music training at a very young age at home. His maternal aunt trained in Indian classical music, and his maternal grandmother used to sing. His maternal uncle played the tabla, and his mother also sang and played the tabla. He studied at Raja Bijay Singh High School and later at the Sripat Singh College, a University of Kalyani affiliate. According to him he "was a decent student, but cared more about music" and his parents decided to train him professionally. He was taught Indian classical music by Rajendra Prasad Hazari and trained in tabla by Dhirendra Prasad Hazari. Birendra Prasad Hazari taught him Rabindra Sangeet (songs written and composed by Rabindranath Tagore) and pop music. At the age of three, he started training under the Hazari brothers, and at the age of nine, he got a scholarship from the government for training in vocals in Indian classical music. Growing up, he listened to Mozart, Beethoven and, Bengali classical music.[citation needed He idolized musicians like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan, Ustad Rashid Khan, Zakir Hussain and Anand Chatterjee, and enjoyed listening to Kishore Kumar, Hemant Kumar and, Manna Dey.</p><a class="more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arijit_Singh#Vocals_and_musical_style" target="_blank">Click here to learn more about Arijit Singh</a>
